# KeyLogger

Obviously I won't upload the exact code. Anyone with sufficient coding skills to be able to fill in the blanks that I leave out and set up their own server, is skilled enough to make this on their own.

The first 230 Lines of code are from a game I made while learning to code in High School. It is just used here to distract from the key logger process being started in the background.
